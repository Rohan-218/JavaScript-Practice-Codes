# README

## Overview

Welcome to the Basic Web Concepts Repository! This repository is designed to help you learn the fundamentals of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Whether you are a beginner or looking to refresh your skills, this repository provides simple and easy-to-understand examples to get you started.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders:

- **html**: Contains HTML files that demonstrate the structure of a webpage.
- **css**: Contains CSS files that add styling to the HTML content.
- **script**: Contains JavaScript files that add interactivity to the webpage.

Each folder contains several example files to illustrate different concepts and techniques.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get the most out of this repository, you should have a basic understanding of:

- How to use a text editor (such as VS Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++)
- Basic command line operations
- How to open a file in a web browser

## Folder Contents

### HTML Folder

The `html` folder contains basic HTML files that cover topics such as:

- Document structure (`index.html`)
- Headings, paragraphs, and lists (`content.html`)
- Links and images (`media.html`)
- Forms (`forms.html`)

### CSS Folder

The `css` folder contains CSS files that demonstrate:

- Basic styling (`styles.css`)
- Layouts using Flexbox (`flexbox.css`)
- Responsive design (`responsive.css`)
- CSS Grid (`grid.css`)

### Script Folder

The `script` folder contains JavaScript files that illustrate:

- Basic syntax and operations (`basics.js`)
- DOM manipulation (`dom.js`)
- Event handling (`events.js`)
- Simple animations (`animations.js`)

## How to Use

1. **Open an HTML file in your browser:**

    Navigate to the `html` folder, choose an HTML file you want to explore, and open it in your web browser. For example, you can double-click `index.html` or drag it into your browser window.

2. **Link the CSS and JavaScript files:**

    Make sure the corresponding CSS and JavaScript files are linked in the HTML file. You can find examples of this in the provided HTML files.

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/styles.css">
    <script src="../script/basics.js"></script>
    ```

3. **Experiment with the code:**

    Feel free to modify the code in each file to see how changes affect the output. This hands-on approach will help you better understand the concepts.
